excerpt: 'Using light-sheet microscopy combined with digital Fourier methods we probe the dynamics of colloidal samples and DNA molecules. This combination, referred to as selective-plane illumination differential dynamic microscopy (SPIDDM), has the benefit of optical sectioning to study, with minimal photobleaching, thick samples allowing us to measure the diffusivity of colloidal particles at high volume fractions.'
