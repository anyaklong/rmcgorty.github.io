excerpt: 'A paper-based microscope makes for a rugged and versatile solution to bringing science and science education to a variety of settings including those that are resource-scarce. This has been well demonstrated by the Foldscope project. Here, we describe an extension to that idea. We designed a paper-based method to control the sample illumination in a portable microscope. Controlling the illumination of the sample allows us to employ a variety of microscope imaging modalities including bright-field, dark-field and phase contrast. With this instrument, students can explore those different techniques. Additionally, it can be used to perform advanced imaging, including quantitative phase imaging, in the field, away from advanced and costly instrumentation.'
