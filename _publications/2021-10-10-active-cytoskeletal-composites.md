excerpt: 'The cytoskeleton is a model active matter system that controls processes as diverse as cell motility and mechanosensing. While both active actomyosin dynamics and actinâ€“microtubule interactions are key to the cytoskeleton's versatility and adaptability, an understanding of their interplay is lacking. Here, we couple microscale experiments with mechanistic modeling to elucidate how connectivity, rigidity, and force-generation affect emergent material properties in composite networks of actin, tubulin, and myosin. We use multi-spectral imaging, time-resolved differential dynamic microscopy and spatial image autocorrelation to show that ballistic contraction occurs in composites with sufficient flexibility and motor density, but that a critical fraction of microtubules is necessary to sustain controlled dynamics.'
