title: "Core–shell droplets and microcapsules formed through liquid–liquid phase separation of a colloid–polymer mixture"

excerpt: 'Microcapsules allow for the controlled containment, transport, and release of cargoes ranging from pharmaceuticals to fragrances. Given the interest from a variety of industries in microcapsules and other core–shell structures, a multitude of fabrication strategies exist. Here, we report on a method relying on a mixture of temperature-responsive microgel particles, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM), and a polymer which undergo fluid–fluid phase separation.'
