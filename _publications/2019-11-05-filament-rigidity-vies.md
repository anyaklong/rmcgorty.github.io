excerpt: 'The diffusion of microscopic particles through the cell, important to processes such as viral infection, gene delivery, and vesicle transport, is largely controlled by the complex cytoskeletal network, comprised of semiflexible actin filaments and rigid microtubules, that pervades the cytoplasm. By varying the relative concentrations of actin and microtubules, the cytoskeleton can display a host of different structural and dynamic properties that, in turn, impact the diffusion of particles through the composite network. Here, we couple single-particle tracking with differential dynamic microscopy to characterize the transport of microsphere tracers diffusing through composite in vitro networks with varying ratios of actin and microtubules.'
