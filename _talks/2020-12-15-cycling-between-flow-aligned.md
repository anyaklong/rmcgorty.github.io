excerpt: 'In this work, we explore the role of shear in structuring colloidal suspensions and how such shear-induced structuring affects rheological properties. We study mixtures of temperature-responsive poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAm) particles about 600 nm in diameter and large polymer molecules acting as depletants. These mixtures undergo fluid-fluid phase separation or gelation depending on colloid and polymer concentrations.'
