title: "Before the breach: Interactions between colloidal particles and liquid interfaces at nanoscale separations"

permalink: /publication/2019-10-09-before-the-breach
excerpt: 'Particles bound to fluid-fluid interfaces are widely used to study self-assembly and to make materials such as Pickering emulsions. In both contexts, the lateral interactions between such particles have been studied extensively. However, much less is known about the normal interactions between a particle and the interface prior to contact. We use digital holographic microscopy to measure the dynamics of individual micrometer-size colloidal particles as they approach an interface between an aqueous phase and oil.'
