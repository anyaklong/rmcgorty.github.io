excerpt: 'The interface between two fluids is roughened by thermally excited capillary waves. By using colloid-polymer systems which exhibit liquid-gas phase separation, the time and length scales of capillary waves become accessible to optical microscopy methods. Here, we study such a system using bright-field optical microscopy combined with a novel extension of differential dynamic microscopy. ='
