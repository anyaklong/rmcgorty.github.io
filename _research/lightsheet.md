We have two light sheet microscopes in our lab. 
1. A system built loosely following the [OpenSPIM](https://openspim.org/) configuration
2. A single-objective system in the open-top configuration

Both systems were constructed with the help of undergraduate students. [Devynn Wulstein](/team/2015-11-01-DW) helped construct the first system. [Ruilin You](/team/2019-06-01-RY) is currently working on building the second.
