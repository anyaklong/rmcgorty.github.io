excerpt: 'While numerous optical methods exist to probe the dynamics of biological or complex fluid samples, in recent years digital Fourier microscopy techniques such as differential dynamic microscopy have emerged as ways to efficiently combine elements of imaging and scattering methods. Here, we demonstrate, through experiments and simulations, how point-spread function engineering can be used to extend the reach of differential dynamic microscopy.'
