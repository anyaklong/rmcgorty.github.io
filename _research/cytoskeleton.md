We investigate the transport properties of colloidal particles and DNA molecules in cytoskeleton networks made of entangled and/or cross-linked actin and microtubule filaments. Lab members use (DDM)[/research/ddm] and (light-sheet microscopy)[/research/lightsheet] with in vitro networks to measure how the crowded biopolymer networks impede motion of particles and macromolecules.
