title: "Force Feedback Controls Motor Activity and Mechanical Properties of Self-Assembling Branched Actin Networks"

excerpt: 'Branched actin networks—created by the Arp2/3 complex, capping protein, and a nucleation promoting factor—generate and transmit forces required for many cellular processes, but their response to force is poorly understood. To address this, we assembled branched actin networks in vitro from purified components and used simultaneous fluorescence and atomic force microscopy to quantify their molecular composition and material properties under various forces.'
