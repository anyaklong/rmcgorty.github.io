Thanks to an [NSF-MRI grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1919429) we have a [DHR-3 rheometer](https://www.tainstruments.com/dhr-3/) which we use to study the rheology (ie, how materials flow or deform when a force is applied) of colloidal fluids, suspensions of DNA, and other materials.
