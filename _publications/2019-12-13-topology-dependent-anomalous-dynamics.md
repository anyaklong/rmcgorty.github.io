excerpt: 'Cytoskeletal crowding plays a key role in the diffusion of DNA molecules through the cell, acting as a barrier to effective intracellular transport and conformational stability required for processes such as transfection, viral infection, and gene therapy. Here, we elucidate the transport properties and conformational dynamics of linear and ring DNA molecules diffusing through entangled and crosslinked composite networks of actin and microtubules.'
