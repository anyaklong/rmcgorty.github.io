excerpt: 'Crowding plays a key role in the transport and conformations of biological macromolecules. Gene therapy, viral infection, and transfection require DNA to traverse the crowded cytoplasm, including the cytoskeletal network of filamentous proteins. Given the complexity of cellular crowding, the dynamics of biological molecules can be highly dependent on the spatiotemporal scale probed. We present a powerful platform that spans molecular and cellular scales by coupling single-molecule conformational tracking (SMCT) and selective-plane illumination differential dynamic microscopy (SPIDDM).'
